These are the slides for Ricardo's 45 minute BOBkonf 2017 talk with
the pretentious title "Functional package management with GNU Guix for
developers and power users" (http://bobkonf.de/2017/wurmus.html).

All slides were created in Inkscape.  Many of the slides use the
"League Gothic" fonts.  Run "make" to convert the SVG files to PDF
with Inkscape and glue them together to one "slides.pdf" with
Ghostscript.

All of the slides are available under the Create Commons license
CC-BY-SA 4.0.
