#+TITLE: We're building the GNU system!

GNU hackers have been building it for three decades, and now GNU Guix is
bundling it up together!  Two years ago in DÃ¼sseldorf Guix was
introduced as a possible way to build the GNU system distribution.  Lots
have been done since then!  We'll present that and showcase the nifty
system configuration and installation tools that have landed recently.
We'll talk about the road to version 1.0 of the GNU system and beyond.

This talk is also a call to GNU hackers to unite and shape up the
system.  Let's GNU things together!

  - dog food

* demo

  - build emacs pre-release:
    guix build emacs --with-source=ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/emacs-24.3.92.tar.xz

* things for GNU maintainers

  - pre-release testing with --with-source
  - provide .scm with package definition
  - could publish .scm files to build the latest & greatest
  - could provide (gnu service ...) modules for their own stuff

* coolness
