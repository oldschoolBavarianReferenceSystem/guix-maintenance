Title: Guix starts fundraising campaign with support from the FSF

The GNU Guix project is glad to announce its first fundraising campaign, supported by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  As the FSF [https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/fsf-announces-support-for-gnu-guix announced today], the campaign’s primary goal is to help increase the capacity of the project’s build farm.  We believe Guix offers a great tool set to increase the freedom and autonomy of computer users, and we are excited that the FSF supports the project!

Until now, the build farm behind hydra.gnu.org had been working on hardware and hosting [https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/donate/ generously provided] by several organizations and individuals—thank you!  To cope with the growing number of [https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/packages/ packages] and users, we felt that the time has come to call to the community to strengthen the project’s infrastructure.  Our first action will be to change the build farm’s front-end, which orchestrates builds and [http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Substitutes.html distributes binaries].  Next we want to add more build machines, with two goals in mind: being able to quickly test changes that trigger lots of rebuilds, and being able to identify [https://savannah.gnu.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=8407 non-verifiable builds].

Donations can be made on the [https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=50 FSF-hosted page for the campaign].  10% of your contribution will also go to help the FSF [https://fsf.org/appeal meet its current fundraising goal].

GNU Guix also welcomes contributions, both technical and non-technical: testing, adding new packages, writing code, translating messages and package descriptions to your native language, helping with Web design, and more.

== About GNU Guix ==

[http://www.gnu.org/software/guix GNU Guix] is a functional package manager for the GNU system.  The Guix System Distribution or GuixSD is an advanced distribution of the GNU system that relies on GNU Guix and [http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html respects the user's freedom].

In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management, per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  Guix uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix package manager, except that packages are defined as native [http://www.gnu.org/software/guile Guile] modules, using extensions to the [http://schemers.org Scheme] language.  GuixSD offers a declarative approach to operating system configuration management, and is highly customizable and hackable.

GuixSD can be used on an i686 or x86_64 machine.  It is also possible to use Guix on top of an already installed GNU/Linux system, including on mips64el and armv7.
