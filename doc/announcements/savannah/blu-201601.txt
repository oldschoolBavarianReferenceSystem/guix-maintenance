== About GNU Guix ==

[http://www.gnu.org/software/guix GNU Guix] is a functional package manager for the GNU system.  The Guix System Distribution or GuixSD is an advanced distribution of the GNU system that relies on GNU Guix and [http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html respects the user's freedom].

In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management, per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  Guix uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix package manager, except that packages are defined as native [http://www.gnu.org/software/guile Guile] modules, using extensions to the [http://schemers.org Scheme] language.  GuixSD offers a declarative approach to operating system configuration management, and is highly customizable and hackable.

GuixSD can be used on an i686 or x86_64 machine.  It is also possible to use Guix on top of an already installed GNU/Linux system, including on mips64el and armv7.
