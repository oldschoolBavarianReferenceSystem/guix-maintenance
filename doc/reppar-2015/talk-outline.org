#+TITLE: Outline of the RepPar talk

* the problem

  - 'module load foo/bar'
    + cluster sysadmin was kind enough to write a "module file" for that
      one
  - 2 months later:
    + ModuleCmd_Load.c(204):ERROR:105: Unable to locate a modulefile for 'foo/bar'
    + or 'foo/bar' has been upgraded
    + or 'foo/bar' has been relinked against upgraded dependencies
    + ...
  - conclusion: unable to reproduce an environment, *even on the same
    machine*!

* types of "reproducibility" we're interested in

  - bit-reproducible builds
    + independent builds of a package should provide bit-identical results
  - environment reproducible for 1 user on 1 machine
    + users should be able to manage constant environments
    + users should able to *choose* when they alter their environments
  - sharing among users on a machine
    + it should be possible, optionally, to share environments among
      users of a cluster
  - sharing across machines => reproducible research
    + reproduce the exact same environment or binaries everywhere

* more than reproducibility: experimentation

  - as scientists we want to be able to change parts of the software
    stack, and see what impact they have
    + example: the MORSE + StarPU + hwloc stack
      * StarPU developers want to test scheduling algorithm on a "real"
        linear algebra application (MORSE)
      * MORSE developers want to compare performance of MORSE with
        different StarPU versions, or assess impact of specific
        compilation flags
      * [[http://icl.cs.utk.edu/quark/docs/group__QUARK.html][Quark]] developers (another run-time system) want to see if
        MORSE-over-Quark outperforms MORSE-over-StarPU
  - as scientists, we demand software systems that can we can fully
    inspect, not black boxes
    + hard to draw any scientific conclusion from an experiment that
      relies on black boxes

* full system Docker/VM image => problem solved!

  - "solution"
    + develop in a VM, take a snapshot when it's good, publish it
    + or: write a Dockerfile that sets up a known-good container image,
      publish it
  - pros:
    - "bit-reproducible" since you essentially publish the bits
    - reproducible anywhere by anyone
    - "proven technology"
  - problems:
    + VMs are heavyweight, not OK for HPC
      * hardware support + KVM + in-kernel page deduplication help, but
        still
    + VM images are completely opaque: how can i reproduce them?
    + Dockerfiles describe steps to /modify/ an opaque image
      * how was the base image produced?
      * do the binary packages of the base distro really correspond to
        the source they claim to come from?
    + in both cases, inspection is difficult: we're given a cake, but
      not its recipe
    + not composable:
      * the full system image is standalone by definition, no way to use
        the software alongside other software packages i may need
      * no way to use, say, the library that's inside the system image
        as-is in my own software system
  - full system images are:
    + coarse-grain
    + the wrong abstraction level

* then, just use a good old package manager?

  - pros:
    + packages are the abstraction level that we want!
    + we get recipes, not just cakes (hopefully; more on that below)
    + well-known, "proven" tools
  - cons:
    + dpkg, rpm, etc. require root, difficult to customize => unsuitable
      on a cluster
    + EasyBuild, Spack, etc.
      * no need to be root!
      * simple recipes that can be shared across machine!
      * allows users to express software variants! (Spack)
    + but:
      * recipes are incomplete: lots of untold expectations (such as
        tool chain) => uncontrolled environment, definitely not
        bit-reproducible packages
      * if we make several cakes, they tend to "blend together": /ad
        hoc/, half-baked handling of package variants, build environment
        not captured

* enter functional package management & Guix

  - explain
  - demo 'guix build' and 'guix environment'
  - use cases

* limitations

  - explain
  - bit-reproducibility
